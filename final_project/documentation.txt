Our game of checkers follows the acceptance rules of the game. It is intended
to be played by a single player against the "computer." 

From the CS50 IDE page, the user should cd in to the "final_project" directory
and run flask and navigate to the Web Server Option in the upper left-hand corner.
Our checkers game will then appear

In the upper left-hand corner of our page, the user has the option to log in 
to his or her Google Account. This functionality will allow the user to keep 
track of past games and scores stored in a sequel database. The user can 
log out at any time using the button at the bottom of the page.

When the user wants to play, he or she must click on the piece to move followed
by the location to which the user wants to move the piece. The user must 
complete all possible jumps before the user's turn is complete. The computer
subsequently chooses its most efficient move. When the computer has moved 
a piece, it is the turn of the user once again.

The exact rules of the game are linked to the page for user's reference. For example,
when the user has the option to jump over an opposite player's piece, it must jump over
that piece. If there are multiple opponent pieces that the user can jump over, then
the user has the choice of which opponent piece to jump over. In addition, when a "double",
or consecutive, move is available, the user must make the consecutive jump.

The game keeps track of the score for each player. The user's scores are positive,
and the computer's scores are negative. The game is over when one of the users runs out
of checkers to play with, or has no possible moves left. The game will alert the user
when the game is over and when a player has won.
